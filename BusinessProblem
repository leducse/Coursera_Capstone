Business Problem Intro

The demographics of Washington DC have changed dramatically over the past 40 years. I would like to explore how the demographics have changed over the past few decades and try to determine what the city will look like in the few decades. I will then take a closer look at some economic wellbeing indicators by neighborhood for more recent years, to help determine the best area of town to live in. This data would be useful to political campaigns, people trying to determine where to open a business, potential home buyers, real-estate investors, and city planners.

Data

The primary dataset I will use will be from http://data.codefordc.org containing demographic information by neighborhood from 1980 to 2010. A few of the metrics I will use to perform this analysis include: 

Population growth by neighborhood - which neighborhoods are growing the fastest? 
Ratio of male to female by neighborhood
Ethnicity demographic changes by neighborhood  
Employment rate by neighborhood population
Average family income
