The demographics of Washington DC have changed dramatically over the past 40 years. 
I would like to explore how the demographics have changed over the past few deccades. 
I would then like to explore the relationship between neighborhood demographic information 
and the type of venues/restaurants in the area. Finally, I would like to try and determine what
the demographics of the city will look like 10 years from now.
